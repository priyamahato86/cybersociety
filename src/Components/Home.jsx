        Welcome to our College Cyber Society Club! We're just a group of
        students who love computers and want to learn more about keeping them
        safe. We started this club because we believe in learning together while
        having fun exploring the world of cybersecurity. Whether it's through
        simple workshops, friendly talks, or interesting challenges, we're here
        to help each other learn new skills and enjoy technology.

        Unlocking the World of Cybersecurity
      </h2>
      <p className="text-justify text-[18px] mt-5">
        In our club, we think the best way to understand cybersecurity is to
        start with the basics. Don't worry if you're new—whether you're just
        learning about computers or already have some know-how, you'll find
        something here to build on. That blinking cursor on your screen?
        Consider it your first friend on a journey into the digital world. If
        you ever have any questions, ideas, or just want to chat, feel free to
        email us at{" "}
        <a href="mailto:cybersociety88@gmail.com">cybersociety88@gmail.com</a>.
        We're all here to help each other out.

        Club Rules
      </h2>
      <p className="text-justify text-[18px] mt-5">
        Our challenges are made to help you learn as much as possible. To keep
        things fair and fun for everyone, we ask that you don't share full
        solutions, write-ups, or livestream your process online. We put a lot of
        effort into creating these resources, and keeping them private helps
        ensure every member gets the best learning experience possible. Thanks
        for understanding!

        Start Here — Learning the Basics
      </h2>
      <p className="text-justify text-[18px] mt-5">
        We've set up our learning materials into different sections called
        "dojos," each covering a specific topic. If you're new, start with the
        beginner dojos and take your time to get comfortable. When you're ready
        to dive deeper, there's always more to explore. And if you ever find
        yourself stuck, our Discord server is a great place to ask questions and
        connect with fellow club members. Let's learn, explore, and build our
        skills together in the fascinating world of cybersecurity!
